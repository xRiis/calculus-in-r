# Calculus in R
A small work-in-progress repository written by Riis Card

## Purpose
This is a growing selection of scripts I'm producing in order to enhance my knowledge of R and review calculus at the same time.  I've done my best to make it as understandable as possible for somebody who has an interest in both subjects by making each script somewhat interactive and also well-commented.  If you're interested in the job that each script has, please go to their respective folders and read about it!

Attached is differentiate.R, which is an example of what to expect from each script: setup, assignment, and display.

## Scripts
* **root/differentiate.R :** Take the first and second derivatives of single- and two-variable expressions
* **root/differentiate/multi_differentiate/multi_differentiate.R :** Take the first and second derivatives expressions with up to four independent variables, and also find the third derivative of each independent variable
* **root/gradient/gradient.R :** Script with the same capabilities as differentiate.R but calculates the gradient and vectors orthogonal to the gradient
